					<eng>After decades of thorough research we located the moon. Our delegation came here to consecrate the cathedral. We knew that something was wrong, but in our pride and arrogance we went too deep under that forsaken cathedral and excavated something that we thought to be the sacred bones. Instead we woke up the slumbering powers of a corrupted artefactâ€¦ may the mercy of the Emperor be with us!</eng>

					<eng>By the grace of the Emperor, an Inquisitorial agent at last! This unholy moon is teeming with the filth of the Immaterium, bending their will to the power of an evil artefact. You must stem their tide before it all spirals out of control!</eng>
				</Desc>

			<node16>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Sinners, we all are! We have brought this upon us! We should have never entered that forsaken ruin. I beg for your mercy and your willingness to hold the tide of darkness until your inevitable death grants you eternal glory!</eng>

					<eng>Emperor preserve us! Know that you are facing the most glorious task of your life-long servitude. Look at that gaping wound on the face of that moon. It is endlessly spitting out spawns of Chaos and you must enter that pit to give them death!</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Emperor, have mercy on us! A swarm of abominations are sweeping over this accursed moon! You must enter the accursed cathedral and stand your ground between hell and mankind!</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Act before it is too late! Face the horde of unnameable monsters bringing death and destruction to everything. They must be stopped before they can spread over the whole moon.</eng>

					<eng>I am only a priest of the Adeptus Ministorium, a survivor of a holy delegation assembled by the esteemed Cardinal Damianus himself. We came out here, to the darkest reach of the void to find the scared relic of the patron saint of our home system. But what we found instead was something that defies words!</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>During the Great Crusade the patron of our system, Saint Aelfred came to this moon and defeated a Daemon Prince in a battle that cost him his life as well. A cathedral was built over his bones, but then, for unknown reasons, the location of the moon was purged from all Ministorium archives.</eng>
