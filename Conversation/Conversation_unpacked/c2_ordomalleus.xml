				<Desc>
					<eng>I salute you, Inquisitor. What is the purpose of your visit?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node1>
			<node10>
				<Desc>
					<eng>And the price we paid was acceptable.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node10>
			<node11>
				<Desc>
					<eng>It was a gruesome outcome. Simply throwing an asset with such tremendous powers into the Immaterium is unworthy of the agents of the Holy Ordos.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node11>
			<node12>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You sound suspiciously soft for an Inquisitor. The Imperium is under attack from every direction and millions are dying even as we speak. The Alpha Pariah was a necessary sacrifice and she served the Imperium well.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node12>
			<node13>
				<Desc>
					<eng>What if she hadn't died? What if the Prophecy was right and she will return one day?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node13>
			<node14>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I don't think we will live long enough to see the conclusion of these events. And I'm fine with that.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node14>
			<node15>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Agreed. The Alpha Pariah proved to be useful, but her existence was problematic from a... political perspective. Those Utherian fanatics are still hiding among our ranks, her presence could incite further heresy and discord.</eng>

					<eng>The rise of Daemonic activity in the Caligari Sector is troubling me, Inquisitor Korax.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node2>
			<node3>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Any news of the Dark Nexus?</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node3>
			<node4>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Your concern shows wisdom. The servants of the Ruinous Powers never rest and their numbers are without end. No sacrifice is too great, no hatred is too strong against such foes.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node4>
			<node5>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You sound almost content.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node5>
			<node6>
				<Desc>
					<eng>Of course. Back in the day, when I served in the Militarum Tempestus, sometimes I felt doubt. Compared to the Daemon, you could almost relate to even the most depraved Drukhari marauder.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>But the spawns of Chaos are different. Their nature is inconceivable to the mind. There is nothing to pity or understand. They are the perfect enemies.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You did the Emperor's work, Inquisitor. Sealing the Dark Nexus saved the whole Sector from a catastrophe on a cosmic scale. The last thing the Imperium needs in these dire times is another Great Rift.</eng>
