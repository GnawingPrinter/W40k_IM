				<Desc>
					<eng>This visit is merely a protocol, Fabricator-General. For now. Tell me about your Forge World.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Accepting the facts isn't optional for my kind, Inquisitor.</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>It is always an immeasurable delight to meet an anointed Inquisitor of the Holy Ordos. How may Forge World Thule assist you?</eng>

					<eng>Inquisitor: About the Machine Spirit of the Martyr...</eng>

				<Desc>
					<eng>Thule, as a planet-size Manufactorum, is currently operating at 97% efficiency. Our devotion to the Imperium can be measured by our Production Grade, which was upgraded to I-Secundi 34.8 Terran Years ago. These facts can be verified in the archives of the Adeptus Administratum.</eng>

					<eng>You sound curiously defensive, Fabricator-General.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node5>
			<node6>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I am fully aware of the rumours surrounding my Forge World, Inquisitor. Tech-heresy, radical experiments, Xenarite sects... these nonsensical claims are undermining our efforts to fulfil the will of the Omnissiah.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node6>
			<node7>
				<Desc>
					<eng>There is nothing to discuss about that particular topic, Inquisitor. The choice you have made is irreversible. Any further dwelling on the matter would be unwise and unproductive.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node7>
			<node8>
				<Desc>
					<eng>You have made the logical choice, Inquisitor. It goes without saying that I respect your authority, but I also respect your logic and calculation. The experiments with the Digital Apotheosis protocol are progressing as we speak.</eng>
				</Desc>
			</node8>
			<node9>
				<Desc>
					<eng>I'm glad you accept my decision.</eng>
